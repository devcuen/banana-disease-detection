## Introduction

Bananas are one of the most important crops worldwide, especially in Ecuador. However, they are susceptible to various diseases that can lead to significant losses. This project focuses on developing a system that can automatically detect diseases in banana plants using deep learning. By using PyTorch, we aim to create a robust model that can be deployed in real-world scenarios.

## Features

- **Deep Learning**: Utilizes deep learning algorithms to identify diseases in banana plants.
- **Computer Vision**: Employs computer vision techniques to analyze images of banana leaves.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple interface for users to upload images and receive disease predictions.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Capable of providing real-time feedback on the health of banana plants.

## Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
- **Transfer Learning**: ResNet architecture
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation

To get started with the Banana Disease Detection System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devcuen/banana-disease-detection.git
   cd banana-disease-detection
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate folder. You can find the dataset in the [Releases section](https://github.com/devcuen/banana-disease-detection/releases).

## Usage

To use the Banana Disease Detection System:

1. Ensure you have the model trained. If not, follow the model training section below.
2. Use the following command to start the detection script:
   ```bash
   python detect.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
   ```

3. The system will output the predicted disease along with a confidence score.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of images of banana leaves affected by various diseases. It includes:

- Black Sigatoka
- Yellow Sigatoka
- Fusarium Wilt
- Healthy Leaves

Images are collected from various sources to ensure diversity. You can find the dataset in the [Releases section](https://github.com/devcuen/banana-disease-detection/releases).

## Model Training

To train the model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset by organizing it into training and validation folders.
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py --data_dir path/to/your/dataset
   ```

3. Monitor the training process. The model will save checkpoints during training.

## Results

After training the model, you can evaluate its performance on the validation dataset. The results will show accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. You can visualize the training process using the provided graphs.
